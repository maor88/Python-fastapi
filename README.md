**Project Overview:**

Design and implement a system that allows users to manage their personal property list. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and then add or remove properties to/from their property list.


1. **User Authentication**:
    - Implement a basic login and sign-up page.

2. **Database Design and Implementation**: 
    - We recommend using SQLite for the sake of simplicity, but feel free to choose another database if you have a specific preference. Justify your choice.
    - Initiate the database using the data from the provided Excel file. Automation is not necessary. 

3. **Backend Development**:
    - Develop a backend in Python to interact with the database.
    - Choose a suitable Python framework (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI, Falcon) and justify your choice.

4. **Frontend Development**:
    - Implement the frontend using Vue.js.
    - Once logged in, users should see their property list.
    - Each property in the list should display:
        - Full Address
        - Class Description
        - Estimated Market Value
    - Users should be able to search for properties from the database.
        - Users should be able to search on the following values:
            - Full Address
            - Class
            - Estimated_Market_Value
            - BLDG_USE
            - BUILDING_SQ_FT
    - Properties should be able to be added to a personal property list of the user. 
    - Properties on the users list should have an option to be removed.
    

5. **Security**:
    - Implement basic security practices for the backend API and user authentication.

6. **Documentation**:
    - Provide a brief README detailing how to set up and run your application.
  
7. **Extra**:
    - **Optimization**: Propose at least one optimization that can help the application perform better under increased data loads.
    - **Additional Feature**: Propose a feature you believe would enhance the user's experience while managing their property list.
